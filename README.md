# OptimizationProblemSolving_using-Gurobi

Programing Language: Python


Problem 1:

a linear programming model using Gurobi optimizer to get the optimal solution to fill this empty bottle with the water from A, B, and C. The objective is  
to maximize the total value of the water in 2.5L bottle.


Problem 2:

Integer linear programming problem to help save money.

Problem 3:

A 7x7 game board  marking  the grids to ensure no more than one grid in the same row or the same column are marked.
Also,  to maximize the sum of the values in those marked grids.
